Installing the program has never been so easy.

##### 3. Double click and run Kahoot.bat
    
## FAQ

#### How do I view the code that was used?

If you click on the number (number of times it tried to use a code), it will open up a seperate window with all of the codes used at that point.

#### Does this actually work?

It can find games, most of the ones I have tried have been finished game, but I have gotten into a random ongoing game.

#### Does this hack into Kahoot?

No, this program just simulates you typing out random codes. This does not in any way hack into Kahoot.
